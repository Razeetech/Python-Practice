"""
This code creates a set s containing the elements {1, 3, 7, 6, 5}.

Then, the discard() method is used on the set s with the argument 4. The discard() method removes the specified element from the set if it is present. If the element is not present, it does nothing and doesn't raise an error.

In this case, since 4 is not present in the set s, the discard() method doesn't do anything. It doesn't affect the set s.

Finally, the print(s) statement prints the modified set s. Since no elements were removed, the output will be the same as the initial set:
