"""
This code snippet initializes two variables s and t, and then prints their types.

s = {}:

This line initializes a variable s as an empty dictionary. In Python, {} represents an empty dictionary, not an empty set. Therefore, s is a dictionary.
t = {1, 4, 5, 2, 3}:

This line initializes a variable t as a set containing the elements {1, 4, 5, 2, 3}.
print(type(s), type(t)):

This line prints the types of the variables s and t.
type(s) returns the type of the variable s.
type(t) returns the type of the variable t.
